Please, bear in mind that every ​USER is solely responsible for the actions undertaken on the application and the information presented by them. \n Password and Security Disclaimer: ​USERS take responsibility for their digital security. The application ​gives the possibility to set up a recovery passphrase, consisting of random unique combination of words. The purpose of the recovery passphrase is to restore the access to the account, once the ​USER has lost access to the original ​Wallet​. Superhero.com does not collect the private keys or the recovery passphrases and shall not be treated under any circumstances as a custodian wallet provider. ​WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL USERS TO SET UP A RECOVERY PASSPHRASE AND PROTECT IT. ​Therefore​, USERS should store their recovery passphrase offline safely. Please bear in mind that if a USER has not set up a recovery passphrase for backup or they have forgotten the recovery passphrase and its exact wording, the access to their accounts can be permanently restricted. The lack of access does not mean in any way that the Superhero.com tokens ​are lost. The ​tokens ​remain available, however, they cannot be controlled, transferred and any other action with them cannot be undertaken. Superhero.com ​shall not be held liable in any case of lost, forgotten or misspelled recovery passphrases. In addition, ​USERS ​must not share their recovery passphrase with anyone. Superhero.com ​should not be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the impossibility of ​USERS to regain access to their account​ on the ​Wallet​. \n Please bear in mind that the option “Already have an account? Retrieve existing account” is applicable only in case the ​USER​ has a recovery passphrase. \n Decentralization and Control Transparency Disclaimer: ​Blockchain technology is decentralized by nature- which means that the makers of ​the Wallet cannot access or freeze your account; recover or reset your recovery passphrase; reverse, cancel or refund transactions. Only ​USERS are in charge of the safe storage and sending of their funds. By agreeing to the present ​TERMS​, ​USERS accept and guarantee to defend, indemnify and hold Superhero.com ​harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, expenses, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, damages, etc., related to or arising from the use of ​the application​. \n Access and Connectivity Disclaimer: ​The Wallet ​can be downloaded from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/superhero-wallet-extension/​. Please bear in mind that the website can delist or remove ​the application in their own estimation, making it difficult to receive updates. Devices on which the ​Wallet is installed are likely to be harmed by malware/spyware/viruses/cyber-attacks, etc. or during technical support. Damage or loss of the device can possibly result in loss of funds or endanger them. Therefore, please refer to section Password and Security Disclaimer in regard to recovery passphrases.
